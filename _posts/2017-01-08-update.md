  * On January 8th, the EFnet RBL domain had expired, and the domain was
    subsequently taken over by a domain spam^Wparker. They went on to return
    *A* responses for all blacklist queries, which made our IRC services cloak
    all incoming connections as coming in over Tor. While investigating the
    cause of the problem, services were restarted, which suddenly made (almost)
    all existing connections to be cloaked as Tor connections as well, and as
    an unfortunate side effect, also akilled a 3-digit number of connections.

    We have disabled the use of EFnet RBL for now, and will work on putting
    sanity checks in place in services which should reject the non-RBL
    responses so this incident should not repeat itself. Sorry for the trouble.

    There are still users connected who are wrongly cloaked as being on Tor.
    Symptoms are being unable to join (or talk in) channels that have banned
    Tor users. To fix, reconnect, or "/msg nickserv set cloak on/off" to toggle
    the personalized cloaks which will override the Tor cloaks.
