  * We have now deployed the [new verification flow](https://github.com/oftc/oftc-webverify)
    that utilizes hCaptcha instead of Google ReCaptcha. Upon registration, the user receives
    a link which they can visit in their browser and solve a captcha. Upon successful completion,
    they will be marked as verified.
    
    Together with this, we have also made the system automatically mark the user as verified on the
    IRC side, making the old `checkverify` NickServ command no longer necessary.

    Should the user need a new link, as they expire after one hour, the new `reverify` NickServ command
    can come in handy.

  * The primary purpose of the old ServicesWeb web application was to facilitate verification.
    With today's changes, we have decided to discontinue it.
