Please consider web voting for the next election

<cpufreak>
I have really enjoyed my term in the network operations commitee, for
the last 6 months. Whatever the results of the election, I remain fully
commited to OFTC.

<gcc>
None at this time

<matt>

<warewolf>

Comment attached with the election:

<anonymous>
Some new method of voting would be keen .. selecting a few
people to be near the end of the results is rather stressful,
when several of them are going to be cut from staff. :-/

<xenium>
wouldnt it have been much easier to make a little php page for this
voting stuff?

<anonymous>
oftc should make cookies made from real girlscouts.  They're nummy.
