# Privacy Policy and Data Retention

This section describes how OFTC makes use of the information you provide when
you use the OFTC IRC network and OFTC.net website (hereinafter collectively
referred to as 'OFTC services').

If you are asked to provide information when using OFTC services, such
information will not be used for any purposes other than those described in
this section.

OFTC collects and uses certain information about users in order to provide
services and enable certain functions.

OFTC may collect the following information:
* Nickname/account on the OFTC network
* Last time an account was used
* IP address/hostname
* Name and E-mail address
* IRC channels created

Collecting the above data helps OFTC deliver its services to you.

Specifically, OFTC may use data:
* To improve the provided services.
* To enable you to reset your password/recover your account.
* To contact you in relation to nickname and channel registrations with OFTC services.
* To respond to a specific enquiry made via e-mail or the support system.
* To analyze traffic for illegal and illegitimate activity (e.g. botnets, spam).

Your OFTC account is kept until you delete it, or it is deleted for inactivity.
OFTC retains logs of IRC events for the purpose of debugging and restoration
for a maximum of 90 days. OFTC's backups are on encrypted storage.

OFTC does not log any IRC traffic content, neither from public channels, nor from
private messages. Individual users connected to the network are able to log
traffic they receive, but we ask all users to act responsibly with that data.
Specifically, publishing IRC channel log files must not be done without consent
of the channel owners.

Please note that the OFTC website and network may contain links to other
websites, and OFTC has no control of websites outside of the OFTC.net domain.
If you provide information to a website or service to which OFTC links, OFTC
shall not be responsible for its protection and privacy.

This policy was last updated on: 22 April 2018.

If you have any questions about OFTC policies, please e-mail support@oftc.net.
