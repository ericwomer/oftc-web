Dear recruit,

Congratulations, you've been voted to the position of
[NetOp](/Network_Operator). If you wish to accept this position, please read on.
If not, please inform a member of the [NOC](/Network_Operations_Committee) that
you do not wish to accept this position at this time.

## Network Operator Guidelines

More than a privilege, this is a responsibility.

We do not select [Network Operators](/Network_Operator) based on technical
merit. Between elections, the [NOC](/Network_Operations_Committee) selects
members of the staff to be [Network Operators](/Network_Operator) based on a
number of factors, including previous record on the Network, social skills, and
the ability to learn from, listen to, and cooperate with other staff and
interact with the users of the Network.

You will be granted an O-line and services Operator access. This will give you
the ability to walk into locked channels, spam everyone on the network, change
channel modes, disconnect users, block hosts, and otherwise be rather god-like
in your abilities. You will also be granted the hostmask cloak
`yournick.netop.oftc.net` and begin seeing and hearing things you may not
have seen before, such as server messages and so-called "GlobOps", messages sent
to all [Network Operators](/Network_Operator) by other
[Network Operators](/Network_Operator).

While you will have these abilities, you may not use them without being able to
justify their use to other network [staff](/staff), especially the
[Ombudsman](/Ombudsman), if such justification is requested. As a member of the
[staff](/staff), you are a representative of the Network and anything you do can
and will be taken to be in the name of the Network. As a result, things which
you do which may have been innocuous as a user may reflect poorly on your record
as a [Network_Operator](/Network_Operator).

As a [Network_Operator](/Network_Operator), your primary task is to respond to calls for help by
users. Usually such calls will involve a channel being flooded, or a problem on
a channel or between users that cannot be resolved without the intervention of
someone from outside. You will also be charged with reconnecting split servers,
if possible, and removing problem users. You may also be called upon by a member
of the [NOC](/Network_Operations_Committee) to help in a
department, in which case other skills, such as technical
skills, may become relevant. Examples of such would be joining the coding staff,
or the infrastructure maintenance staff.

Any time there is a non-routine incident that you respond to, such as removing a
user or shutting down a channel, you must report it and log it in the Network's
logs. This paragraph will apply when we have such logs, meanwhile, a note should
be sent to eventlog@lists.oftc.net.

Because [Network Operators](/Network_Operator) are not selected on technical
merit, it is possible that you do not have the first clue how to use your
abilities as a [Network_Operator](/Network_Operator). There is no shame in this, and I strongly
encourage you to seek help from other staff or even select a mentor from among
the staff when learning how to carry out the tasks outlined below.

Failure to abide by these guidelines may result in a review by the [Ombudsman](/Ombudsman)
or by the [NOC](/Network_Operations_Committee), potentially resulting in
disciplinary action ranging from a note on your record to expulsion from staff.

If you have questions, suggestions, or comments about your role, feel free to
contact other members of the [staff](/staff).
