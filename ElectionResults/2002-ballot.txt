the total results.

1st place = Chair (Coordinator)

___     This constitution is appropriate for OFTC.

Constitution of the Open and Free Technology Community

1. Mission Statement

   The Open and Free Technology Community (henceforth referred to as
"OFTC" or "the Project") was founded at the end of 2001 by a group of
experienced members of the Open Source and Free Software communities
aiming to provide these communities with better communication,
development, and support infrastructure. Our goal is to provide stable
services to members of the community in any part of the world, while
listening closely to their needs and desires.

2. Administrative Structure

   Any action that any Staff member takes in the performance of their duties
shall be recorded in the Project's records as completely as is possible.

   The following outlines all Staff positions.

2a. Project Administration Committee

   The Project Administration Committee (henceforth referred to as "the PAC")
will consist of no fewer than six members. The PAC is responsible for deciding
the policies of the Project as a whole.

   i) PAC Coordinator

     The Coordinator is responsible for calling and chairing PAC meetings.
The Coordinator is also responsible for the appointment of Department Heads.
Department Heads are to be selected from willing and able members of the PAC.

     The Coordinator is responsible for announcing and coordinating elections,
as described below.

   ii) Department Heads


     The responsiblitiess of Department Heads are set by the Coordinator at
the time of their appointment, as explicitly as is reasonable. Department
Heads are strongly encouraged to recruit Department Staff from among Staff and
users willing to assist them in their duties.

2b. Project Ombudsman

     The Ombudsman is responsible for hearing and acting on complaints
received by users or Staff, when is about a member of Staff or about the
Project as a whole.

     The Ombudsman has the power to issue Reprimands against any Staff member
for violating any Project policy, any part of this constitution, or for
abusing any of their privileges. This reprimand may be turned over by a
three-quarters majority vote of the PAC. The Ombudsman may also recommend that
further action be taken against the Staff member in question.

     Reprimands against Staff only take effect after the following PAC
meeting.

     In order for the PAC to issue a reprimand, it must file a complaint with
the Ombudsman.

     The Ombudsman is also responsible for issuing Commendations to Staff
members and volounteers who are performing exemplary service to the Project.
This commendation will be reflected in the Project's records.

2c. Project Administrator (Admins)

   Project Administrators (henceforth referred to as "Admins") are to enforce
the Project policies set forth by the PAC. They are also responsible for
helping any and all users of the Project in any way possible, without
prejudice.

   Any further responsibilities, and all privileges, are defined in the
Project Policy document.

2d. Sponsors

   Sponsors are responsible for maintaining the hardware, connectivity, and
operating system installation upon which our software runs.

2e. Project Representatives (Reps)

   The duties of a Project Representative include assisting users in any way
possible, and reporting any problems to the Admins, the PAC, or the Ombudsman.
They need only be reported when the problem cannot be solved without
privileged intervention.

2f. Active and Inactive Staff

   A Staff member who has not logged any activity in seven days will be

considered inactive.

   An Active Staff member is any Staff member who is not Inactive.

2g. Inter-Election Staff Changes

   A Staff member who is inactive for sixty days, without notice, will be
removed from Staff. Any Staff member who announces their resignation will have
their privileges and any access they may have removed.

   Any vacancies in Staff are filled at the earliest possible time by the PAC,
based on candidates put forward by PAC members or Administrators. Candidates
who are volounteers or who are already on Staff, and candidates who have
Commendations, will be favoured to fill any vacancies.

   The PAC may appoint new Staff members, promote Staff members, create new
Staff roles, or remove Staff members who are detrimental to the Project.
For Staff removals, the Ombudsman must consent.

2h. Impeachment

   In the event that any PAC member or the Ombudsman is performing poorly or
in a manner detrimental to the Project, it is the duty of the Admins and the
rest of the PAC to bring about a vote of no confidence.

   Following a public discussion, in order for a vote of no confidence to be
passed, a minimum of three quarters of all active Admins and three quarters of
all PAC members must agree. After this two-part agreement, the impeached
member will be stripped of all Staff positions, privileges, and access.

   The vote of no confidence must be completed within seven days of the
original call for an impeachment.

2i. Vacancy at the level of either Coordinator or Ombudsman

   In the event that the Coordinator should, for any reason, cease to be
the Coordinator, the PAC will elect an interim Coordinator from among Staff.

   In the event that the Ombudsman should, for any reason, cease to be the
Ombudsman, the PAC will select a new Ombudsman from willing and able Staff
members.

2j. Reprimands

   How members of Staff behave in public reflects upon the Project as a
whole. Therefore, any action which misrepresents Project policy may result in
the Reprimand or dismissal of the Staff member in question. Any Reprimands or
dismissals, and the reasons therefor, shall be explained in Project records.

   A Reprimand carries the following weight:

     * 1 Active Reprimand: 7 day suspension from Staff.

     * 2 Active Reprimands: 30 day suspension from Staff.

     * 3 Active Reprimands: Dismissal from Staff.

   Appeals shall be handled by the PAC on a case-by-case basis. The
Ombudsman who issued the reprimand may only serve as a witness to these
proceedings; they may not participate.

   Reprimands cease being active after a period set by the Ombudsman, not
to exceed 180 days.

   Staff members often go above and beyond the call of duty. For this
reason, the Ombudsman may award a Staff member a Commendation and announce
this fact to the Project.

3. Voting

3a. Eligibility and Candidates

   Voters in elections shall be limited to Staff members, as defined by this
Constitution.

   No new Staff members may join during a thirty-day period before an
election.

   A member of Staff may only be eligible if they have received no more
than one reprimand since the previous election.

   All voters shall also be candidates. There are no nominations. Any
voter may elect any other voter for any position. A voter must also vote
themselves into some position.

   In the event that an active Staff member can not vote during the

the results of elections. No members of staff will know who the counters are
until the results are released. The votes themselves must be anonymised before
being sent to Software in the Public Interest.

3e. Election Structure

   Elections and election results are to be handled in the following manner:

        * Any outstanding issues which need to be voted on will be listed
on the ballot.

        * Each voter assigns a list of numbers, starting at 1 and ending at
the total number of candidates, to all candidates. No number may be assigned
more than once, and all numbers must be used.

        * The individual with the lowest cumulative ranking will be the
PAC Coordinator. The first- through eighth-lowest will be the Project
Administration Committee.

        * The individuals with the ninth- through sixteenth-lowest ratings
will be Project Administrators.

        * Those ten percent of candidates with the highest cumulative ratings
will be removed.

        * All remaining candidates will be Project Representatives.

        * The Ombudsman is selected by a write-in ballot; that Staff member
whose name appears most oftenwill be the Ombudsman.

        * In the event of a tie which affects the roles of two or more
different Staff members, a run-off vote will be held. The run-off vote will
only contain the names of those candidates affected. If the candidates reach
an agreement within 48 hours of the election results being announced, no
run-off vote will be held.

3f. Forced Elections

   If the PAC shrinks to below six members for more than thirty days, a
new election must be held if none is scheduled within the following thirty
days.

document. The purpose of this document is to decide the day-to-day
operations of the Project. It may not conflict with any articles in this
Constitution.

   Any Policy enacted in the Project Policy document shall have the same
weight as any article in this Constitution. The Project Policy document
may be altered by any standard PAC vote.

5. Amendments

   Amendments to this document must be approved by two thirds of all
active Project Staff.

   Software in the Public Interest (SPI) may veto any amendments or
changes to this constitution within 15 days of the Staff's vote.
