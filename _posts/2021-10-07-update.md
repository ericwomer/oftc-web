  * We've reconfigured our
    [Let's Encrypt TLS certificates to not use the expired DST Root CA X3](https://letsencrypt.org/2021/10/01/cert-chaining-help.html),
    which should resolve issues with some clients and older TLS
    implementations.  Note that if you're using Android older than 7.1.1, you
    will no longer be able to connect without manually trusting the Let's
    Encrypt CA.
