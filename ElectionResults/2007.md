Peter,

Michael Schultheiss and I are in full agreement on the election results,
which by the thinnest of margins show you as new chairman. Congratulations!

Please find attached my counts, Michael will send his own version
separately.

Kind regards,

Bert Hubert

General notes
- -------------
There were 19 ballots cast, of which 15 were valid. maxx (Martin Wuertele),
scott (Scott Bender) and cryogen (Stuart Walsh) all assigned a rank twice,
RichiH sent in his ballot too late.

Valid votes came from: Ganneff  Matthew  Maulkin  Myon cdlu
luca  luk  matt  mc  nemith  rik  seanw  weasel  yang  ziga

The ballot form  was in conflict with itself, there were 40 candidates, but
voters were asked to assign ranks from 1-39. A classic off-by-one.

Ombudsman scores (per nick, as used on the ballot):
     10 cdlu
      8 Matt
      7 weasel
      7 tjfontaine
      4 sarnold
      4 christel
      4 Myon
      4 Maulkin
      3 nemith
      3 luca
      3 cryogen
      3 RichiH
      2 maxx
      2 Ganneff
      1 seanw
      1 scott
      1 robster
      1 rik
      1 mc
      1 luk
      1 denny
      1 alindeman
      1 SportChick
      1 RavidgeMole
      1 Matthew
      1 Hydroxide

This means cdlu has been voted ombudsman.

Removal scores (per nick, as used on the ballot):
      4 alindeman
      4 marienz
      3 LoRez
      3 RavidgeMole
      2 seanw
      2 denny
      2 SportChick
      2 Hydroxide
      1 dmwaters
      1 christel
      1 RichiH
      1 scott
      1 rik
      1 miro
      1 hajvan
      1 Hawkwind

This means nobody meets the threshold for removal.

YES/NO questions:
'Do you agree with the following people being Advisors?'
Pierre Machard: 12 times 'yes', 2 times 'no', 1 times no answer - which is
counted as a yes. Final result: 13 times 'yes' versus 2 times 'no'.

'Do you believe OFTC should remain a member project of Software in the Public
Interest?'
14 times 'yes', 1 times no answer, which is counted as a yes. Final result:
15 times 'yes'.
