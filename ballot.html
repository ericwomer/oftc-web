Section 1: Staff Rankings

Please rank all staff from 1-28.

- You may want to use https://www.oftc.net/voting/ to make it easier to
  vote. If you don't, read the following rules:
- Do NOT use the same number twice;
- Either completely fill out the ranks or do not fill them out at all; a
  partially filled ballot cannot be counted accurately and will be
  discarded;
- Check as many Ombudsman boxes as you would like. The individual with the
  most checks will be the Ombudsman;
- Check as many Remove boxes as you'd like. More than half of all votes
  must have an individual's Remove box checked in order for that
  individual to be dismissed;
- (S) denotes people who sponsor servers among their roles;  Removing
  a sponsor will mean we delink their servers also.

   1-8       NOC
   9-16      Network Operators
