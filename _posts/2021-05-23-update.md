  * [Privacy Policy updates](/Privacy_Policy) - New accounts now have
  the flag **PRIVATE** turned on by default, all old accounts have
  this flag turned on forcefully **ONCE** as of now. This means that
  the mail address used for registration is no longer visible by
  default to other users, only [IRCOps](/staff).

  We have also updated our privacy policy to include more details on
  which data is visible to who (including other users).
