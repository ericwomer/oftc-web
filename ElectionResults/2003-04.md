Section 3: Ombudsman
	While, Constitutionally, the number 2 person on the ballot is the
	Ombudsman, a fair system is to allow voters to explicitly select
        an Ombudsman. If the number 2 person in section 1 and the
        Ombudsman selected here are not the same person, the number 2
        person will be asked if they object to this person becoming
        Ombudsman in their stead.

Please specify the full name and/or nickname of the staff member you would
	like to be OFTC's Ombudsman:


Section 4: Yes/No questions. Unanswered questions will be counted as a "Yes",
	so please ensure that if you object, you write "No".

Yes/No	Issue - No answer will be counted as a "Yes"
___	Do you believe OFTC should remain a member project of Software
	in the Public Interest?

Comment attached with the election:

<anonymous>
Some new method of voting would be keen .. selecting a few
people to be near the end of the results is rather stressful,
when several of them are going to be cut from staff. :-/

<xenium>
wouldnt it have been much easier to make a little php page for this
voting stuff?

<anonymous>
oftc should make cookies made from real girlscouts.  They're nummy.
